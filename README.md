The even numbered pages (moves 51+) are intentionally printed
upside down. The reason is to avoid having the the wired spiral
notebook binding interfere with recording moves. Players can instead
turn the page and rotate the scorebook upside down in order to
maintain the spiral binding on the lefthand side.
